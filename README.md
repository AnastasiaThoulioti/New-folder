# Data Preparation and Cleanup

This section outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and usability.

#### Import & Clean Up Data

I start by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset, followed by initial data cleaning tasks to ensure data quality.

```python
# Importing Libraries
import ast
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from datasets import load_dataset
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  

# Loading Data
dataset = load_dataset('lukebarousse/data_jobs')
df = dataset['train'].to_pandas()

# Data Cleanup
df['job_posted_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['job_posted_date'])
df['job_skills'] = df['job_skills'].apply(lambda x: ast.literal_eval(x) if pd.notna(x) else x)

```

### Filter Greece Jobs

To focus my analysis on the Greek job market, I apply filters to the dataset, narrowing down to roles based in the United States.

```python
df_GR = df[df['job_country'] == 'Greece']
```


# The Analysis

## 1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?

To find the most demanding skills for the top 3 most popular data roles, I filtered out those positions by which ones were the most popular and got the top 5 skills for these top 3 roles. This query highlights the most popular job titles and their top skills, showing which skills I should pay attention to depenting on the role I'm targeting.

[2_Skills_Demand.ipynb](Project\2_Skills_Demand.ipynb)

### Visualize Data

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(job_titles), 1)


for i, job_title in enumerate(job_titles):
    df_plot = df_skills_perc[df_skills_perc["job_title_short"] == job_title].head(5)[::-1]
    sns.barplot(data=df_plot, x="skill_percent", y="job_skills", ax=ax[i], hue="skill_count", palette="dark:b_r")

plt.show()
```

### Results

### Insights

- Python is a versatile skill, highly demanded across all three roles, but most prominently for Data Scientist (73%) and Data Engineers (65%).
- SQL is the most requested skill for Data Analysts and Data Scientists, with it in over half the job postings for both roles. For Data Enginners, SQL is the most sought-after skill, appearing in 71% of job postings.
- Data Engineers require more specialized technical skills (AWS, Azure, Spark) compared to Data Analysts and Data Scientists who are expected to be proficient in more general data management and analysis tools (Excel, Tableau)


## 2. How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?

To find how skills are trending in 2025 for Data Analysts, I filtered data analyst positions and grouped the skills by the month of the job postings. This got me the top 5 skills of data analysts by month, showing how popular skills were throughout 2025.
View my notebook with detailed steps here:(Project\3_Skill_Trend.ipynb)

## Visualize Data

```python

from matplotlib.ticker import PercentFormatter

df_plot = df_DA_GR_percent.iloc[:, :5]
sns.lineplot(data=df_plot, dashes=False, palette="tab10")

plt.cga().set_major_formatter(PercentFormatter(decimals=0))

plt.show()

```

### Insights

-Alteryx showed the most significant surge in demand, peaking dramatically at approximately 34% of job postings in July.This demand was short-lived and highly concentrated, as the likelihood for Alteryx was near 0% for all other months. This suggests a massive, time-bound hiring effort for a specific project or role requiring this specialized tool.
-Azure showed high, yet spiky, demand. It peaked at approximately 12% in May and again in October.Despite the low overall count, the alternating peaks of Azure indicate that cloud skills are essential, with Azure being the primary focus for most of the year.
-AWS maintained a very low profile, only showing demand (approx. 5%) in January.
-Bash command-line skills saw a strong surge in the middle of the year, peaking at approximately 17% in June. This often suggests a need for skills in automation, scripting, and manipulating data pipelines.
-BigQuery was almost non-existent until the end of the year, where it showed a strong, sudden peak of approximately 11% in December. This indicates a potential shift towards or a significant project launch on the Google Cloud platform towards the end of the 2025 cycle.
-All skills, except for Azure, show extended periods where their likelihood in job postings is 0%. This points to a job market that is not seeking a broad, generic Data Analyst but is intensely focused on one or two niche skills at any given moment.

## 3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analyst?

To identify the highest-paying roles and skills, I only got jobs in Greece and looked at their median salary. But first I looked at the salary distributions of common data jobs like Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and Data Analyst, to get an idea of which jobs are paid the most.

View my notebook with detailed steps here: (Project\4_Salary Analysis.ipynb)

### Salary Analysis 

#### Visualize Data

```python
sns.boxenplot(data=df_GR_top6, x="salary_year_avg", y="job_title_short", order=job_order)

ticks_x = plt.FuncFormatter(lambda y, pos: f'${int(y/1000)}K')
plt.gca().xaxis.set_major_formatter(ticks_x)
plt.show()

```
#### Results

![Salary Distributions of Data Jobs in Greece](Project\images\Salary_Boxplot.png)
*Box plot visualizing the salary distributions for the top 6 data jobs titles.*

#### Insights

-Salary ranges vary substantially across job titles in Greece. Roles such as Senior Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer show the highest earning potential, with salaries extending toward the upper end of the chart. This indicates strong demand for advanced technical expertise and industry experience.

-Senior Data Engineer and Senior Data Scientist roles show a considerable number of outliers on the higher end of the salary spectrum, suggesting that exceptional skills or circumstances can lead to high pay in these roles. In contrast, roles such as Data Analyst and Data Scientist exhibit more compact salary distributions with fewer extreme outliers, indicating more predictable salary expectations compared to senior roles.

-The median salaries increase with the seniority and specialization of the roles. Senior roles (Senior Data Scientist, Senior Data Engineer) not only have higher median salaries but also larger differences in typical salaries, reflecting greater variance in compensation as responsibilities increase.

### Highest Paid & Most Demanded Skills for Data

Next, I narrowed my analysis and focused only on data analyst roles. I looked at the highest-paid skills and the most in-demand skills. I used two bar charts to showcase these.

#### Visualize Data

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 1)

#Top 10 Highest Paid Skills for Data Analysts
sns.barplot(data=df_DA_top_pay, x="median", y=df_DA_top_pay.index, hue="median", ax=ax[0], palette="dark:b_r")

#Top 10 Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts
sns.barplot(data=df_DA_skills, x="median", y=df_DA_skills.index, hue="median", ax=ax[1], palette="light:b")

plt.show()

```

#### Results

Here's the breakdown of the highest-paid & most in-demand skills for data analysts in Greece:

![The Highest Paid & Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts in Greece](Project\images\Highest_paid_and_most_in_demand_skills_for_data_analysts.png)
*Two separate bar graphs visualizing the highest paid skills and most in-demand skills for data analysts in Greece.*

#### Insights

-The top graph shows specialized technical skills like `aws`, `express`, and `docker` are associated with higher salaries, some reaching up to $1600K, suggesting that advanced technical proficiency can increase earning potential.
-The bottom graph highlights that foundational skills like `Java`, `R`, and `Python` are the most in-demand, even though they may not offer the highest salaries. This demonstrates the importance of these core skills for employability in data analysis roles.
-There's a clear distinction between the skills that are highest paid and those that are most in-demand. Data analysts aiming to maximize their career potential should consider developing a diverse skill set that includes both high-paying specialized skills and widely demanded foundational skills.

## 4. What are the most optimal skills to learn for Data Analysts?

To identify the most optimal skills to learn ( the ones that are the highest paid and highest in demand) I calculated the percent of skill demand and the median salary of these skills. To easily identify which are the most optimal skills to learn.

View my notebook with detailed steps here: (Project\5_Optimal_Skills.ipynb)

#### Visualize Data

```python
from adjustText import adjust_text
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df_DA_skills_high_demand.plot(kind="scatter", x="skill_percent", y="median_salary")
plt.show()

```

#### Results

![Most Optimal Skills for Data Analysts in Greece](Project\images\Most_Optimal_Skills_for_Data_Analyst_in_Greece.png)
*A scatter plot visualizing the most optimal skills (high paying & high demand) for data analysts in Greece.*

#### Insights

-The skill `Java` appears to have the highest median salary of nearly $1.4 Million, despite appearing in less than 20% of job postings.
-Skills like `Docker`,`Kubernetes`, `Linux`, `express` and `aws` are clustered together with extremely high median salaries (between $1.4M and $1.6M). This suggests that Data Analysts who possess strong engineering and infrastructure skills are highly valued but rarely sought, indicating that these roles may be specialized Data Engineers or ML Engineers disguised as Data Analysts.
-`Python` and `SQL` are the cornerstone skills for the Data Analyst market in Greece.SQL is the most demanded skill by a wide margin, appearing in approximately 50% of all job postings. While its median salary (around $1 Million) is high, it is lower than highly specialized skills, reflecting its foundational nature.Python offers the best balance of high salary (around $1.2 Million) and high prevalence (around 48% of jobs). Proficiency in Python appears to be the most rewarding skill for the majority of Data Analyst roles.
-`Power BI` and `Tableau` show significant demand (around 25% prevalence) with median salaries ranging from $800K to $1 Million. This confirms that visualization and reporting capabilities are a crucial, expected part of the role.
-`Spreadsheet` and `git` are the skills with the lowest median salaries (below $600K), despite being fairly common. This suggests that while these tools are essential prerequisites, they do not drive salary potential on their own.
-Skills related to cloud services (`Azure`) and specialized database/ETL tools (`SAS`, `Spark`, `Databricks`) typically cluster between the $900K and $1 Million median salary mark, suggesting that while they offer good remuneration, they are still viewed as secondary to core scripting (Python) and query (SQL) skills.

#### Visualizing Different Technologies

We'll add color labels based on the technology (e.g., {Programming: Python})

#### Visualize Data

```python
from matplotlib.ticker import PercentFormatter

# Create a scatter plot
scatter = sns.scatterplot(
    data=df_DA_skills_tech_high_demand,
    x='skill_percent',
    y='median_salary',
    hue='technology',  # Color by technology
    palette='bright',  # Use a bright palette for distinct colors
    legend='full'  # Ensure the legend is shown
)
plt.show()

```

#### Results
